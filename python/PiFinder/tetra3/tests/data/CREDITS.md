## Databases

Note that BSC5, being limited to bright stars, is a small database which is convenient for testing. 
However, it is not suitable for building pattern databases with fields of view smaller than 20 degrees. 
Production users of Tetra3 should build their pattern databases from the 'hip_main' or 'tyc_main' catalogs.
